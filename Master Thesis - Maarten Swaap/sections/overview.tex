\chapter{Overview}\label{s:overview}
This overview contains a Utility Tree, which captures the Architecturally significant requirements (ASR). These ASRs are extracted from interviews (interviewee description in Appendix  \ref{Appendix A}) and combine with the Business Goals and Concerns (available in Appendix \ref{Appendix B} and  \ref{Appendix C}) 

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{||l l l||}

 Business Goal(s) (BG) & Concern(s) (C) & Architectural Significant Requirement (ASR) \\ [0.5ex]

\end{table}

Concerns C-07, C-08 and C-11 and BG-06 are not addressed in this overview, because the scope of this research is not taking in account laws, exceptions and non-government organizations. However, these concerns are considered possible relevant for future research and therefore included in the appendix.

C-01 Knowledge of systems and what is legally allowed    &   Area of expertise within the identity domain is complex and system specialists (NL: Stelselspecialisten) and other specialists are a rare resource. History of law and systems is implicit knowledge or hard to find in documentation. When designing new systems it's needed to comprehend the domain and its internal and external influences. & I-03\\
