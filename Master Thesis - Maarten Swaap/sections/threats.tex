\section{Internal Validity}
This research provides a set of architecturally significant requirements, tactics and patterns. Combined with an interpretation how to embed these tactics and patterns.
This set can be considered as a starting point and viable selection. However, it will not rule out these tactics and patterns are already in place or other tactics and patterns are better suitable in some situations. If the interviews would be conducted with different subjects in other government or non-governmental organisations it can be assumed the set of variables will be extended or even considered inexhaustible.

\section{External Validity}
A restricted amount of time and available resources resulted in a limited sample of subjects and interviews. The outcomes of the interviews can be considered as a pilot and therefore a starting point for further research and actions within governmental organisations. However, the interviewees are experts in the domain of personal identity within the Dutch government. Consulted interdepartmental by other government institutions when it comes to the design and content of the Personal Records Database (BRP) as an identity system. A source of truth and knowledge base of historical design decisions for different ministries and government departments. Involved as peer reviewer for government standards on information technologies or changes within the BRP. All subjects have more than 10 years of working experience at the National office for identity data.  

\section{Construct Validity}
Within this qualitative research semi-structured interviews are used to collect data. On the one hand, this method is chosen because the subjects are experts in their fields of expertise namely personal identity. Limiting them to a questionnaire or structured interview would not provide unexpected and new information or insights in their field of expertise or a correct understanding of the operational problem. On the other hand, the use of an open form of data gathering techniques like unstructured interviews could result in an unlimited stream of information and history. Hence, semi-structured interviews are chosen to provide answers on research question 2 and 3.

Applying semi-structured interviews need acknowledgement on the bias introduced by the researcher. Blandford \etal \cite{Blandford2016QualitativeHR} define that semi-structured interviews “inevitably bring in the interests of the researcher as well as the participant.”. Also, Blandford \etal define the shaping of data gathering by a researcher as follows: “The researcher is shaping the conversation and the data that is gathered, and the extent of that shaping should be recognized and reported transparently and unapologetically.” The researcher influences this research by knowledge on the field of interest and as a colleague of interviewees within a Dutch government body.

\section{Reliability}
To test reliability it has been made possible to verify or replicate this research by providing a replication package. Replication package is available on GitHub \url{https://github.com/mswaap1985/Master-thesis}.
The implementation sections covers one pattern and a set tactics. It can be argued there is a more extensive set of patterns and tactics that can be applied.
Trade-offs and possible gaps in these solutions are composed by logical reasoning of researcher. Discussion and explicitly captured rationale is needed to validate the use-cases before implementing a solution.
