\section{Design of experiment}
This research puts solutions within the context of a software architecture. It has been done in an inductive research method. The research is based on a theory stating encryption technologies
could be applied more broadly. Theory is gained through literature study and input is gathered via semi-structured interviews. The output of the interviews is coded, resulting in the output for the overview and design section. Validation of output will be done via a focus group working within a relevant project.
