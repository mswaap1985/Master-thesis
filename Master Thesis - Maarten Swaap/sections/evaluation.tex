\section{Design of experiment}
The research is based on a theory stating privacy breaches of citizens are a growing issue and technologies could be applied more broadly to mitigate it. In the design phase of the experiment there seemed to be a clear scope focusing on a UIN as a secluded problem and techniques of tokenization and pseudonymization to be a set of viable possible solution. After commencing this research it became clear the UIN is not an insulated problem and more techniques and solutions can be taken into account. Otherwise it would have possibly resulted in a too broad scope of the problem and a too narrow view on solutions.

Therefore, theory of the problem was gained through literature study and a practical understanding of problems, goals and solutions was gathered via semi-structured interviews with experts in the field of governmental identity data.

\section{Methodology}
Research method is an inductive exploratory approach, based on the theory technologies could support privacy preservation of citizens. During this research understanding the possible problems was part of it. Therefore being an interpretive research.

Experts where consulted on bringing focus to the research problem and scope. These consulted experts referred to available literature and therefore these conversations where not recorded and transcribed. Semi-structured interviews where used for the same reason, but are used to get a more detailed view. The interviews are transcribed and information is extracted by using the coding method.  Williams and Moser \cite{Williams2019TheAO} claim: "Regardless of the research approach, the methodology employed for data collection and
organization must be clear and repeatable, leading to and enabling data analysis..... A key data organizing structure in qualitative research is coding." This is why coding method has been used.

Firstly transcribing the interviews is part of the "Data collection and Analysis" phase. "Open coding" has been done by marking possible interesting parts, based on the themes of Business Goals and Concerns. The step of "Axial coding" results in refinement to Quality attributes of ISO-25010. Defining Quality Attributes considered Architecturally Significant refinements are defined in the last part of "Selective Coding". The "Theory Development" and "Constructing Meaning" phase are result in Attribute refinements and Quality Attribute scenarios. Section \ref{s:overview} contains the Utility tree to depict the cohesion between these steps. In this way coding has been applied on methodology described in Software Architecture in Practice of Bass\etal \cite{Bass2015SoftwareAI}.

Biases will be discussed in the section 'Threats to validity'

\section{Obtained results}
Themes in the form of Business Goals and Concerns are included in Appendix \ref{Appendix B} and Appendix \ref{Appendix C}. The results of translating them to Quality Attributes and Attribute Refinements in Figure \ref{fig:ASR1} combining them with the Business Goals and Concerns in Table \ref{ASR_BG_C}.
