\section{Summary of contributions}
\todo{Link problem definition and solution(s) }
This research demonstrates a broad scope of quality attributes to take in account when designing software architecture that involves exchange of personal information. This research tries to contribute to a high-level understanding and decomposes one Quality attribute to show the possible patterns and tactics. However, the research does not conclude which techniques to use, because fields of expertise like encryption is an area of expertise for its specialists.

\section{Implications for future research}\label{Implications}
On terms of knowledge assurance concerns C-01 and C-02 are describing knowledge of systems and legal applications. These concerns are not resolved in this research but need to be addressed and can be input for further future research on embedding knowledge. Not only looking at the aspects of software systems (for example pattern libraries) but also the organizational aspects of embedding knowledge (for example in-sourcing strategies). 
In Section \ref{s:related} related work shows methods on evaluation and comparison when selecting appropriate software architectures. For future research these methods could be applied on outcomes of this research.
