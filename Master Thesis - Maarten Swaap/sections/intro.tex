\section{Motivation}
Main objective of this research is scoping the problem of identity theft to make it possible to decompose the problem to quality attributes of the ISO 25010 standard to support matching process of generically usable patterns and tactics which can be applied building software.

\section{Research question}
How can information systems reduce the possibility to commit identity fraud, without losing the benefit of exchanging personal data of a citizen within the government of The Netherlands, and how can further suitability for these methods be assessed?

\begin{quote}\emph{RQ1: What is the definition of identity fraud and which concrete problems can be identified?}\end{quote}
\begin{quote}\emph{RQ2: Which requirements are significantly relevant to assess technical suitability and trade offs of these technologies for broader usage within the Dutch government?}\end{quote}
\begin{quote}\emph{RQ3: Which available architectural tactics and patterns are available and can be used to mitigate identity fraud?}\end{quote}

\section{Scientific and practical contribution of this research}
Implementing a system implies software architecture is present and architectural choices have been made. Bass '\etal \cite{Bass2015SoftwareAI} defines software architecture as "a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them." Also, Bass \etal formulate every software system has an architecture, only not always formally described.
The research objective is to explicitly describe goals and concerns relevant when designing information systems which could mitigate identity fraud. Thereafter, breaking it down this information in a formal description of Quality attributes (QA) and Architectural Significant Requirements (ASR). Based on these QA's and ASRs a selection of available architectural patterns and tactics will be discussed and possible trade-offs will be reasoned.

This will contribute in selecting the appropriate technologies and facilitates mitigating identity fraud. Making use of a selection of architectural patterns and tactics that already exist which can make it possible for practical application. The provided definition and quantification of Identity theft can be used to raise awareness on this problem and serve as an base for future research.

The contribution to science and practice will be achieved by defining which quality attributes are relevant when designing software architecture. Based on the ISO 25010 standard of Software Quality Attributes, not only the attribute of 'Security' will be taken into account. A broader perspective of goals and Architectural Significant Requirements, together with concerns will support a broader view when developing information systems. The patterns and tactics can help designers and builders build and assess their information system.

This research will not answer the question which method should be used for implementation. Also, it can be assumed business goals, concerns, requirements and technology will evolve over time, resulting in a continuously evolving set of variables to take in account.
